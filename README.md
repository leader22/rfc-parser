# rfc-parser
## Motivation

RFC documents are not easy to read.

- bare text format
- manual line break
- not mobile friendly
- etc...

If we could parse RFC texts into formatted tokens, we can create our own viewer with them!

## WIP -> RIP

I succeed to parse some RFCs, but some could not.

- To distinguish `text` line and `figure` line is hard
  - In my opinion, it's impossible...
- And also `list` line, it is too

By reasons above,  I stopped working on.
